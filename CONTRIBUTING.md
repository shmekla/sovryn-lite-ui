# How to contribute

I'm really glad you're reading this, because we need volunteer developers to help this project come to fruition.

If you haven't already, come find us in discord ([#sovryn-lite-ui](https://discord.gg/HrEQPZncNT)). We want you working on things you're excited about.

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to repository](https://github.com/defray-labs/sovryn-lite-ui/pull/new/develop) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). When you send a pull request. We can always use more test coverage. Please follow our coding conventions (below) and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "feat(lending): a brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

We follow these [conventional commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) rules when making our commits.

## Coding conventions

Start reading our code and you'll get the hang of it.
We are using eslint and prettier - so better have it enabled in your IDE.

Thanks,
Defray Labs
